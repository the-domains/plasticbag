> I am providing a full range of strategic, creative and technical expertise in the area of digital communication --- specialising in user interface and interactive design.

I am a highly experienced digital creative living and working in Berlin. I develop and execute visual concepts for large-scale projects from the finance, automotive, public transport and retail sector.
